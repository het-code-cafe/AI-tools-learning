# README.md

This is a repository used to generate plots and other learning materials 
for AI courses, including ML and Data Science. 

This repository contains a variety of diagrams (Mermaid & Napkin), plots (plots folder, all generated with the CCPlots module) and code examples (ray.so folder). 
Most of these plots have also been created with some AI assistance!

## Contents

- [Matplotlib & seaborn plots](#matplotlib--seaborn-plots)
- [Code snippets (in presentation)](#code-snippets-rayso)
- [Mermaid diagrams (in presentation)](#mermaid-diagrams)
- [Styling](#styling)
- [Sources](#sources)
- [Plot Showcase](#plot-showcase)

## Matplotlib & Seaborn plots

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py`: contains a function to render all plots again, 
or a scratchpad to re-render specific plots. You can also run the implementation
files to regenerate a single plot.

## Code Snippets (ray.so)

The code examples for the slides can be found in ray.so_images. They are, 
of course, made with ray.so.

Settings:
- Theme: meadow
- Background: off
- Margin: 16px
- Languages used: Python, Markdown

This folder also contains code snippets used for the presentation. Some are 
just small snippets, others are fully functional scripts to play around with.

## Mermaid Diagrams

In the `mermaid` folder we store the syntax for the mermaid diagrams in `.md` files and store 
`.svg` and `.png` renders.

## Styling

Everything here uses styling from `colour_reference.md`, which contains the 
CodeCaf√© colours as well as some supporting colours to complete the palette.

## Machine Learning with Python

Python has many libraries for Machine Learning. While the defaults are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn, there are several domain-specific 
libraries available too!

## Plot Showcase

Enjoy some cool plots! That need somewhat better styling in the sizing and letters 
and margins.
