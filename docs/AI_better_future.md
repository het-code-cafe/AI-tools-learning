# AI for a Better Future

In recent times, AI has been criticised for its environmental impact. The [ethics & law](AI_ethics) 
sources identify potential ethical problems and highlight previous AI mishaps. AI might hold many 
limitations and challenges, but also has the potential to bring good to the world. 

To bring some balance and nuance into the conversation, this article will highlight some of the great work 
that is done with the help of AI.
