## Community

There is a huge community around AI and Machine Learning, with many free materials to learn more online. 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is a community with many data sources, example code, models and 
[learning materials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn). 

[Huggingface](https://www.huggingface.co) also deserves a special mention for its 
extensive collection of open-sourced Machine Learning models.
